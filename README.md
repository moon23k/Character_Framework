## Data_Augmentation
A large amount of data is essential for training deep learning models. However, it is quite difficult to obtain a large amount of high-quality data to apply to the desired task. Therefore, in this repo, a series of methodologies that can compensate for the lack of data are presented separately by task.

## Strategies

**Generate with Pre-trained Model** <br>

<br>

**Web Crawling** <br>

<br>

**OCR** <br>
In addition to data accessible on the web, various texts exist in our real life. And most of the text is written on paper. Among these, text that is suitable for the user's intention and is free from copyright can be extracted through OCR. Of course, a series of steps are additionally required to transfer the hard copy to the computer, but it is useful when data is desperately needed.
